#I'M DOIN' (imdo.in)

[See it in action!](http://one19.codes/)

### WHAT THIS WEBSITE DO
Shows a status of what you're doing! When using the npm package `im-doin` and properly setting it up (once that step is done, that is), you'll be able to fire off status updates with a message and a color/image/(eventually a valid gradientstring or one of a subset of pre-rendered svgish backgrounds), and have it display on your own `imdo.in` website!

### TODO:
*LOTS! THIS ISN'T READY FOR WIDE RELEASE:*
* Resume footer
* Time since last update footer
* Button to request status update in *time-since* footer
* break out db location into .env file
* Bunch of svg/tiled emoji backgrounds
* README DOCS
* MOAR README DOCS ABOUT SETUP
* EVEN MORE DOCCOS! LET'S MAKE THIS DEAD SIMPLE FOR **ANYONE** DEV-Y TO DO
* tests/ci/test&coverage badges
* (think about adding the possibility for the status message to be a link)
